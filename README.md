# Exploratory Analysis with Python

This was a small project to showcase some of the tools and techniques I have previously used to clean and analyse data using python in the past. The jupyter notebook file contains all code and markdown text to explain each step of the process. 

To cover all the skills I have learned related to data cleaning and analysis would make the project much too long. Therefore, the project just covers a few of the techniques as an exmaple of the work I have carried out.
